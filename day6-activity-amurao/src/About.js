            I am currently working as a Technology Consultant at a Multinational company, focused on building Enterprise-level applications.
            I am a certified professional with various certifications on computer programming, cloud computing, and project management.
            When not in work, I usually eat a lot, sleep most of the time, and spend other time watching other things that would help me get interested on learning.
